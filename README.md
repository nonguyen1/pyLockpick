# pyLockpick

This is my solution for solving the lock pick problem hosted HackMIT 2018
puzzle #3.

## The challenge follows as: 

You'be been recruited to be trained to be the master lock picker. We present
you the finest lockpicking training program, the Lockpick Simulator 3000.

Your mission is to acheive more than a golden number lockpicks under 20
seconds. Get a 100 lockpicks, and you will unlock the answer.

_FOR MAC USERS open the application by using ./lockpick_

## How to use:
Make sure you have the required modules installed by using the following
command: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After you have all the require modules, run the script using the command

```
python pyLock.py
```

There should be no output to the terminal. I avoided using
prints because depending on your cpu speed, print statements may reduce
efficiency. This is to ensure the program will complete 100 lockpicks in 20
seconds.
